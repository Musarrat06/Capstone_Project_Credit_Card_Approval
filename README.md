# Capstone_Project_Credit_Card_Approval:

### Credit Card Approval Machine Learning Project:
This project aims to develop a supervised machine learning model to predict credit card approval decisions based on customer information and historical data. The model utilizes a dataset of customer attributes and their corresponding credit card approval outcomes.

**Key Features:**
Dataset: The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing customer information, including demographics, income, credit history, employment details, and other relevant features.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering. Various techniques such as data imputation, scaling, and categorical encoding are employed.

Model Selection: Multiple machine learning algorithms are considered and evaluated to identify the most suitable model for credit card approval prediction.
Model Training and Evaluation: The selected model is trained on the labeled dataset and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Predictive Functionality: The trained model is utilized to predict credit card approval decisions for new customer data, providing real-time insights.

**Dependencies:**
GoogleColab(ipynb),
MYSQL

**Libraries:** scikit-learn,
pandas, matplotlib, numpy.

**Results and Evaluation:**
The model achieves the highest accuracy of 91.61% on the test dataset by using RandomForest and 91.18% by XGBOOST, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting credit card approval decisions.
A detailed analysis of the model's performance and evaluation metrics can be found in the project documentation.
